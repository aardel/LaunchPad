# Placeholder for extension icons

You'll need to create icon files here:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these from a single high-resolution icon (256x256 or larger) using an image editor or online tool.

For now, the extension will work without icons, but browsers may show a default placeholder.
